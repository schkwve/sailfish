# Sailfish - Lightweight, Cross-Platform E-Mail Client

# So... what can it do?

As of now, Sailfish is in a very early stage of development. I'm working on implementing SMTP to _just work_. Then, security functions will come next, and the GUI last.

# Building

To build Sailfish, simply run `make`. For more build options, run `make help`.
